==================================================================================================================
Difference between AbstractFactory and Factory design patters are as follows:
The difference is that the intended purpose of the class containing a factory method is not to create objects, while an abstract factory should only be used to create objects.
Factory Method is used to create one product only but Abstract Factory is about creating families of related or dependent products.
Factory Method pattern exposes a method to the client for creating the object whereas in case of Abstract Factory they expose a family of related objects which may consist of these Factory methods.
Factory Method pattern hides the construction of single object where as Abstract factory method hides the construction of a family of related objects. Abstract factories are usually implemented using (a set of) factory methods.
AbstractFactory pattern uses composition to delegate responsibility of creating object to another class while Factory design pattern uses inheritance and relies on derived class or sub class to create object.
The idea behind the Factory Method pattern is that it allows for the case where a client doesn't know what concrete classes it will be required to create at runtime, but just wants to get a class that will do the job while AbstractFactory pattern is best utilised when your system has to create multiple families of products or you want to provide a library of products without exposing the implementation details.!
