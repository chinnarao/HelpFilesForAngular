1. abstraction:Abstraction is the idea of simplifying a concept to its bare essentials in some context. It allows you to better understand the concept by stripping it down to a simplified version.

The examples above illustrate abstraction — look at how the Fight class is structured. The way you use it is as simple as possible — you give it two heroes as arguments in instantiation and call the fight() method. Nothing more, nothing less.

Abstraction in your code should follow the rule of least surprise. Your abstraction should not surprise anybody with needless and unrelated behavior/properties. In other words — it should be intuitive.

2. encapsulation:Encapsulation can be thought of as putting something inside a capsule.In most languages, this is done through the so-called access modifiers (private, protected, and so on). 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. polymorphism:

4. composition:

5. association:  Defines a loose relationship between two components. Both components do not depend on one another but may work together.
   Example: Hero and a Zone object.

6. aggregation:Defines a weak “has-a” relationship between a whole and its parts. Considered weak, because the parts can exist without the whole.
Example: HeroInventory and Item. 
A HeroInventory can have many Items and an Item can belong to any HeroInventory(such as trading items).

7. Generalization:

8. Decomposition
Decomposition is the action of splitting an object into multiple separate smaller parts. Said parts are easier to understand, maintain and program.
