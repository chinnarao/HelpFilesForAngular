--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BasicHttpBinding: =>  ASMX, Https.
WebHttpBinding: =>   REST, XML/JSON,
WSHttpBinding: => Http/Https, WS - * spec: WS–Reliable Messaging, WS - Transactions, WS-Security:not supported by BasicHttpBinding
                wsHttpBinding= basicHttpBinding + WS-* specification
WsDualHttpBinding: =>wsHttpBinding plus Bi-directional communication means both clients and services can send and receive messages.
NetTcpBinding: =>TCP protocol,Faster and more reliable binding as compared to the Http protocol bindings. 
                 It is only used when communication is WCF - to – WCF means both client and service should have WCF.
NetNamedPipeBinding: => 	"Named Pipe binding" Communication between two services on the same machine. 
                          most secure and fastest binding   among all the bindings.
NetMsmqBinding: =>MSMQ, for transport and offers sup-port to disconnected message queued. It provides solutions for disconnected                    scenarios in which service processes the message at a different time than the client send the messages.
WSFederationHttpBinding: =>It is a specialized form of WS binding and provides support to federated security.
NetPeerTcpBinding: =>TCP protocol but uses peer net-working as transport. In this networking each machine (node) acts as a client and a server to the other nodes. This is used in the file sharing systems like torrent.
MsmqIntegrationBinding: =>MSMQ
