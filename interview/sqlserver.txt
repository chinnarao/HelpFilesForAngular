difference between UNION and UNION ALL? UNION ALL command is equal to UNION command, except that UNION ALL selects all the values. 
The difference between Union and Union all is that Union all will not eliminate duplicate rows, instead it just pulls all the rows 
from all the tables fitting your query specifics and combines them into a table.performance wise , union all is good than union.

delete vs truncate ? DELETE operations can be rolled back (undone), while DROP and TRUNCATE operations cannot be rolled back.
The advantage to using TRUNCATE TABLE is that in addition to removing all rows from the table it resets the IDENTITY back to the SEED, 
and the deallocated pages are returned to the system for use in other areas.TRUNCATE statements do not fire triggers. 
You cannot specify a WHERE clause in a TRUNCATE TABLE statement. DELETE TABLE statements delete rows one at a time, logging each row in
the transaction log, as well as maintaining log sequence number (LSN) information. Although this consumes more database resources and
locks, these transactions can be rolled back if necessary.
